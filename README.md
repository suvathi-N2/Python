🎮 How the Snake Game Works (Explained Simply)

🐍 Objective:

The player controls a snake that moves around the screen.
The goal is to eat food, which makes the snake grow longer.
The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.


---

🧠 Behind the Scenes (Working Model):

1. Game Setup:

The game is made using the pygame library in Python.

A window of size 600x400 is created.

The snake and food are drawn as blocks (small rectangles).


2. Movement Control:

The arrow keys control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right).

Each time you press a key, the snake's head moves in that direction.


3. Food Spawning:

A green block appears randomly on the screen.

When the snake’s head touches the food, the food disappears, and:

The snake’s length increases by 1.

A new food block appears at a random location.



4. Growing the Snake:

The snake is stored as a list of positions.

Every time it eats food, a new segment is added to the list (snake grows).

The longer the snake gets, the harder the game becomes.


5. Game Over Conditions:

If the snake’s head hits the wall, the game ends.

If the snake’s head touches its own body, the game ends.

After game over, it shows a message:

Press C to Continue

Press Q to Quit



6. Score Display:

The score is shown at the top-left of the screen.

It increases every time the snake eats food.

🎥 2-Minute Narration Tip (Voice-over Script Sample)

> “This is a simple Snake game written in Python using the Pygame library.
The objective is to control the snake using arrow keys and eat the green food blocks.
Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and your score increases.
But be careful! If the snake hits the wall or its own body, the game ends.
We use Python lists to store the snake's body, and random numbers to place the food.
The game loop handles the movement, growth, collision detection, and scoring.
This project helped me learn about game development basics and how to use Pygame in python.
